# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game in MIPS Assembly

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in MIPS Assembly! This project offers two exciting versions of the classic game.

## 🌟 Features

- **V1**: Two-player mode 👥
- **V2**: Player vs Computer mode 🧠

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the game, you'll need a MIPS assembly simulator. We recommend using [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).

1. Clone this repository
2. Open MARS
3. Load the desired version (TTT-V1.asm or TTT-V2.asm)
4. Assemble and run the program

## 🕹️ How to Play

### V1: Two-Player Mode

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid
2. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the grid
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

### V2: Player vs Computer Mode

1. Choose your symbol (X or O)
2. Take turns with the computer placing symbols on the grid
3. Try to outsmart the computer and win the game!

## 🧠 AI Strategy (V2)

The computer in V2 uses a simple strategy to play the game. It prioritizes:

1. Winning moves
2. Blocking player's winning moves
3. Taking center square if available
4. Taking corners
5. Taking any available square

## 🛠️ Technical Details

This project is written in MIPS Assembly language, demonstrating low-level programming concepts such as:

- Memory management
- Branching and looping
- Subroutine calls
- User input handling
